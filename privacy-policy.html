                            </p>
                            <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States
                                (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected
                                and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.
                            </p>
                            <p>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</p>
